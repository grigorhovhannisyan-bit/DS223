# Customer Churn Survival Analysis Report

## Key Findings

 The models identified critical factors affecting customer churn in the telecommunications dataset with a 27.4% churn rate. Internet service subscription is the most severe churn driver, cutting customer lifetime by 50%, followed by voice service which reduces it by 33%, indicating service quality issues. Premium service tiers demonstrate good retention effects: E-service customers stay 3.3 times longer, Plus service 2.6 times longer, and Total service 2.9 times longer than Basic service customers. Demographic stability also plays a significant role, with married customers staying 1.57 times longer, and each additional year of age or address stability adding approximately 4% to customer lifetime. The most valuable segments are Plus service customers with mean CLV of $2,009, customers aged 50+ have $2,098, and married customers have $1,866, collectively representing over $1.5M in lifetime value. With an expected annual value loss of $112,771 due to churn, I'd recommend an annual retention budget of from $11,277 to $22,554 focused on internet and voice service quality improvements, targeted upgrade campaigns from Basic to premium tiers, and loyalty programs for high-value demographic segments.
